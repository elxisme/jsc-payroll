# JSC Payroll Management System - Database Setup

## Quick Setup Guide

Follow these steps to set up your database with real data:

### Step 1: Set up Database Schema
1. Open your Supabase dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/projects
2. Go to your project
3. Click "SQL Editor" in the left menu
4. Copy the entire contents of `database-schema.sql` 
5. Paste it into the SQL editor
6. Click "Run" to execute

This will create:
- ✅ All database tables (users, staff, departments, payroll, etc.)
- ✅ Nigerian CONJUSS salary structure (Grade Level 1-17, Step 1-15)
- ✅ Standard allowances and deductions
- ✅ 15 Sample Nigerian court departments
- ✅ Row Level Security policies
- ✅ 4 Test user accounts

### Step 2: Add Sample Data (Optional)
If you want to add 50 sample staff members and payroll data:

```bash
node initialize-database.js
```

This will add:
- 50 staff members across different departments
- Current month payroll run
- Individual payslips for all staff
- Sample notifications

### Step 3: Test Login
Use these test accounts to log in:

| Role | Email | Password |
|------|-------|----------|
| Super Admin | superadmin@jsc.gov.ng | password123 |
| Account Admin | admin@jsc.gov.ng | password123 |
| Payroll Admin | payroll@jsc.gov.ng | password123 |
| Staff | staff@jsc.gov.ng | password123 |

**Note:** In production, these passwords should be properly hashed. For testing, they're simplified.

## Database Structure

### Security Features

## Nigerian CONJUSS Integration

The system includes the complete Nigerian Consolidated Judicial and Salary Structure:

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"relation already exists" error**
   - You've already run the schema. That's fine!
   - Skip to Step 2 or clear your database first

2. **Authentication error in initialize-database.js**
   - Make sure your VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY are set
   - Check the Environment Variables section in Replit

3. **RLS policy errors**
   - Make sure you're using the test accounts provided
   - Check that you're logged in before accessing data

### Need Help?
- Check the Supabase dashboard for error logs
